## Marketing Campaign Incrementality Analysis: Measuring the Impact on Revenue

### Project Overview
This project aims to measure the **incrementality** of a marketing campaign. Incrementality refers to the additional impact (e.g., sales, revenue) generated by a campaign that would not have occurred without the campaign. By leveraging experimental design, causal inference, and econometrics techniques, we can isolate and quantify this impact.

### Data Preparation

### Data Source
The dataset used in this project is the **UCI Online Retail Dataset**, which contains transactional data for a UK-based online retail store. The data includes information such as `invoice number`, `stock code`, `description`, `quantity`, `invoice date`, `unit price`, `customer ID`, and `country`.

### Preparation Steps
1. **Filtering Data:** Included relevant features such as `TotalRevenue`, `Campaign`, `Quantity`, and `UnitPrice`.
2. **Handling Missing Values:** Removed rows with missing values.
3. **Date Conversion:** Converted date columns to `datetime` objects.
4. **Aggregation:** Aggregated data on a weekly basis to analyze trends over time.

### Analyses Performed

### A/B Testing
**Rationale:** A/B testing allows us to compare the performance between a control group (not exposed to the campaign) and a treatment group (exposed to the campaign). This helps in measuring the direct impact of the campaign.

### Difference-in-Differences (DiD)
**Rationale:** DiD analysis helps to account for time-varying factors that might affect the outcome. By comparing the changes in revenue before and after the campaign for both control and treatment groups, we can isolate the effect of the campaign.

### Regression Analysis
**Rationale:** Regression analysis controls for confounding factors (e.g., quantity, unit price) and isolates the effect of the campaign. This method provides a more detailed understanding of how different variables influence the total revenue.

### Analysis Results

### A/B Testing
- **Control Group Mean Revenue:** 21.28
- **Treatment Group Mean Revenue:** 17.51
- **T-Statistic:** 4.02
- **P-Value:** 0.000058

**Interpretation:**
The p-value is much less than 0.05, indicating that the difference in mean revenue between the control and treatment groups is statistically significant. This suggests that the observed difference in revenue is unlikely to have occurred by chance.

### Difference-in-Differences (DiD)
- **Mean Difference Pre-Campaign:** 1694.06
- **Mean Difference Post-Campaign:** 497.36
- **Difference-in-Differences:** -1196.69

**Interpretation:**
The negative DiD value suggests a substantial decrease in average revenue per customer during the campaign period compared to the pre-campaign period, indicating that the campaign may have negatively impacted revenue.

### Regression Analysis
An Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression was conducted to control for confounding factors and isolate the effect of the campaign on total revenue.

**Interpretation:**
- **R-squared:** 0.856
  - Indicates that 85.6% of the variability in total revenue is explained by the model.
- **Adjusted R-squared:** 0.856
  - Adjusted for the number of predictors in the model, providing a more accurate measure of model performance.
- **Campaign Coefficient:** -0.7179 (p-value = 0.314)
  - The campaign variable is not statistically significant, indicating no significant effect on total revenue after controlling for quantity and unit price.
- **Quantity Coefficient:** 1.5750 (p-value = 0.000)
  - Quantity has a highly significant positive relationship with total revenue.
- **UnitPrice Coefficient:** -0.7907 (p-value = 0.000)
  - Unit price has a highly significant negative relationship with total revenue.

### Recommendations

#### Campaign Review
- **Targeting:** Evaluate the target audience to ensure the campaign is reaching the right customers.
- **Messaging:** Review the campaign messaging to ensure it resonates with the target audience.
- **Offer:** Assess the offers and incentives provided during the campaign to ensure they are compelling and attractive to customers.

#### Focus on Quantity
- Strategies to increase the quantity sold have a positive impact on revenue and should be prioritized.

#### Price Sensitivity
- Review and possibly adjust pricing strategies to mitigate the negative relationship between unit price and revenue.
